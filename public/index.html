                  <p>Getting the lighting period correct is important in prevention of algae. If your lighting period is too long then you could be asking for algae! It's worth putting your lights on a timer to ensure your plants are getting the same amount of light each day.</p>
                  <p>Avoid setting your lighting period for longer than 8 hours. Most planted aquariums do not need more than 8 hours of light.</p>
                  <p>Avoid setting your lighting period for longer than 6 hours in NEW planted aquarium set-ups. During the first month your lighting period should be shorter to keep away algae while your plants grow in.</p>

                  <p><b>Ammonia (NH₃)</b> Ammonia is extremely toxic to fish. This is naturally broken down by good bacteria in your filters. Until your tank has completed the Nitrogen Cycle it will probably be present in small amounts in your tank. For this reason, it is imperative to only add very hardy fish during the beginning stages of the Nitrogen Cycle. In an established tank, any levels above zero would typically indicate that the tank is over stocked or the filter is poorly maintained.</p>
                  <p><b>Nitrite (NO₂)</b> Nitrites are the result of ammonia being broken down by bacteria in your tank – they are the secondary product of the Nitrogen Cycle. Though less harmful than ammonia, nitrite is still very toxic to tropical fish. In new tanks, these levels will rise very shortly after ammonia levels level off and being to drop. When you test for nitrates in your cycled tank, you ideally want a result of 0ppm. The only way to remove Nitrites from your tank is to perform weekly water changes (25% - 30%).</p>
                  <p><b>Nitrate (NO₃)</b> Nitrates are the result of Nitrites being broken down even further by the beneficial bacteria in your filtration system – the third and final product of the Nitrogen Cycle. Nitrates are not particularly harmful to fish and their presence signals the complete cycling of your tank. In very high levels, however, they too can become a stress on fish. Nitrate levels should be between 20 and 40 ppm to remain in a safe range. To decrease the amount of nitrates in your tank, perform consistent water changes.</p>

        5) What are the advantages of live plants?

              <p><b>Filtration</b> Plants act as a natural filter in your aquarium. Unlike filters that hang on the back of your tank, plants are in the trenches of your tank which allows them to absorb waste and other debris within the tank, thus keeping it healthier for your fish. Besides absorbing waste, plants also create additional surfaces for beneficial bacteria to grow on.</p>
              <p><b>Algae Deterrent</b> No one wants algae in their aquarium. The more plants you have in the aquarium, the fewer algae you’re likely to have. This is because plants can out-compete algae for nutrients thus allowing for fewer algae to grow. </p>
              <p><b>Home Improvements</b> Since plants provide shelter within the tank, they allow different types of fish to co-exist much better. Fish can hide from other fish in the tank if they need to. Some types of fish are also known to breed and leave eggs on the plants.</p>
              <p><b>Food</b> Don’t worry most fish won’t devour your plants. But, in the event they need another food source (or you forget to feed them) the plants are there as another source of nutrition.</p>
              <p><b>Nature</b> Think about where fish thrive. It’s not typically in a glass tank with plastic decor. Fish are used to being around plants. <br>
              When you add plants you’re providing fish with a little taste of home. When fish are comfortable in their surroundings they are more likely to thrive, much like us!</p>
